# Ray tracer

I am building a ray tracer from scratch. 

## Dependencies
* A recent compiler (c++17)
* CMake

## Usage

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/johansolbakken/raytracer2022
cd raytracer2022
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # configure generator
~~~

Then, find and run one of the examples and open the image created.
